    You need at least one sitemap to use cache warming.
    Simple xml sitemap can be created with :ref:`TYPO3's SEO extension. <t3coreapi:xmlsitemap>`.

This section describes how to properly use the extension in various ways.
Basically the cache warming can be executed in two different modes: Either
for whole sites based on their XML sitemap or for single pages based on
their page ID.
